My first post

Hey, welcome to visit my blog. There is an opportunity know that it could create a personal blog on github several month ago, 
then I have trying to create a blog, it's faild. Until someday I had saw a project called Papery which could build blog automatically, cool~
I am clone codes immediately and try to run it in my local environment. But it does running on nodejs environment, I am a beginner for nodejs
and related everything. So I am following the article of Papery step by step, it still cannot running on my local environment successfully.
Cause the time factor, I don't have researching it. Last week I saw it again when I tiding my folders, I did reset up it again, I have 
success to run it. So that's why I have this blog. 
In this blog, I want to log something regarding to software development and skills what's I learn. Just for fun, it is very important.
Rome was not built in a day, keeping learn.
